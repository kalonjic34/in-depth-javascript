# FizzBuzz Challenge

When you go to get a job as a web developer, you may be given specific programming challenges. It's good to practice challenges like this not only for job interviews, but it sharpens your skills in general. You'll find that most challeneges have some kind of iteration involved. One of the most common challenges is the FizzBuzz challenge. This has to do with loops and conditionals, so I think that this is a good challenge at this point in the course.

**Instructions:**

- Print/log the numbers from 1 to 100
- For **multiples of three** print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For **multiples of five** print "Buzz"
- For numbers which are **multiples of both three and five** print "FizzBuzz".

**Hints:**

If you have taken the course up to this point, then you know how to write a loop and output/log something for each iteration. You also know how to check for a condition with "if/else/else if". You also know how to get a remainder of a number using the modulus operator (%). This is all you need to know to complete this challenge. Good luck!
